description: Build and run the native client in development mode (with debug logging).
---

1. Run the dev command:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```
   *Note: This usually builds the project first and then launches it.*

2. If you need to see logs in a separate terminal or after the fact:
   ```bash
   tail -f ~/.cache/proton-drive/proton-drive.log
   ```
