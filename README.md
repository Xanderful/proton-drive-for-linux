# ProtonDrive Linux Client

An unofficial Linux desktop client for ProtonDrive with a graphical interface, using `rclone` as the backend.

## Important Note

This repository is currently under active development. The application on the `main` branch is not functional and should not be considered stable.

Development is ongoing in the `dev` branch. Please refer to that branch for the latest progress, but be aware it is not fully working yet.

We are working hard to bring a stable and functional ProtonDrive Linux client. Thank you for your patience!
